    text: `A vertical approach means that you would start with Model, test it, then move on to View, test it, and finally move on to Controller. A horizontal approach means you would make something simple across Model, View and Controller, test it, and then work on another thing. It really depends on how your group plans it, although both may work to your advantage. It's good to find a way to divide the work in order to parallelize your team's time, knowledge and energy. Don't forget to nominate a leader, and it's good to have test branches or test repos to see if a new technology will work. As Albert Einstein said, 'We cannot solve problems with the kind of thinking we employed when we came up with them.'`,

    text: "This is probably the hardest assignment in the course so far. Plan your time wisely and start by studying the solution to the Week 14 Mini Project, as it is a working model. Understand what you can from it, and adapt it to your needs. It's not a bad idea to start with the Model, then moving on to some basic Views, and then working on the Controller. It's a good idea to do as much as you can on this assignment before Project 2 starts! Don't forget to include a good quality README, and space your code out with lots of comments. As Mahatma Gandhi said, 'Learn as if you will live forever, live like you will die tomorrow.'",

Show users how to connect to their DB, run the schema and seed the database. Then, test the CRUD operations in your database and show the completion of the operation by running another GET route. Try to commit and push your work after each piece of code is written, edited or deleted. If you can, organize your files for sustainability and readability. Don't forget to include a great README!

The video should go through all of the technical acceptance criteria and any bonus actions you managed to do. Your management system table schema should follow the one in the homework instructions. Finally, your repository should have a unique name and an excellent folder structure. As Herman Melville said, 'It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.'",

Users should be able to visit your live app, create and save persistent notes, then review any previously created note. Notes should be able to be deleted as well. Despite the number of files, try to have a clean folder structure at the root of your repo. It goes without saying that a good quality README is vital. As Colin R.

Keep a steady commit history and make little changes as you go. If your code breaks somewhere, you have a history of working commits that you can revert back to. As Henry David Thoreau said, 'Success usually comes to those who are too busy looking for it.'",

When your API returns no results, you should give some feedback to the user. If you are using a modal, make sure the modal contents are sized correctly inside it. With your CSS variables, make sure you follow the kebab-case naming convention and do not use snake_case or camleCase. Finally, make sure everyone contributes at least one important thing to the project in order to get the 'Even Contribution' mark. As Calvin Coolidge said, 'The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.'",

Try to do a good job on your local storage by having it in a dropdown as the list could get pretty long. This is one of those projects you should put on display. Also, try and do a good job on your README — make it look really clean.

After all the questions are answered, the timer should stop, the quiz should end, and the user should be able to save their initials and high score into local storage. The quiz should look fantastic as well as function flawlessly! The quiz should be mobile-responsive which is absolutely amazing. As W. P.

The application should be properly deployed and upon clicking Generate Password the user should be prompted with several choices on the length and type of characters the user would like in their password. The addition of the default choices and check marks once a selection is made would be a very nice touch indeed. Make your repo and README look great. The repo should have several well commented commits and the code should have consistent indentation. The README should have badges to show what tech was used, how the application works and screenshots. As Alexander Graham Bell said, 'Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work in hand. The sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus.'",

The page design should be properly mobile responsive. The code repo should be well maintained and documented, with a strong README, good code comments, and plenty of quality commits.

You'll really impress the grader if you do very specific comments and organize your work! Keep up the hard work as the class gets more difficult!
